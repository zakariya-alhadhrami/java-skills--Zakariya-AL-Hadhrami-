"1.  what i have learned by doing the Tasks is that failing is part of the journy and Testing the code is the most important part and the readabilty of the variable helped me faster to alocate them."


" 2. the most chanllenging part was about the arrys and Strings since it is new environment i have to learn and adapt to it , by time goes i will have the knwledge enough to grow"
